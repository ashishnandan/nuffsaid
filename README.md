A simple python program which solves below problem :

Part 1 : 

Write a method (or a method per question if you'd prefer) that loads the data out of the CSV file
you downloaded and computes answers to the following questions:

How many total schools are in this data set?
How many schools are in each state?
How many schools are in each Metro-centric locale?
What city has the most schools in it? How many schools does it have in it?
How many unique cities have at least one school in it?

### Prerequisites:
Python 3.3+ installed

### Run the program 
python3 count_schools.py


Part 2:

We'd like teachers to be able to easily find the school they teach at. In order to do this, we'd like to offer a search feature that lets them search for their school using plain text.

This feature should search over school name, city name, and state name.
The top 3 matching results should be returned (see below for examples).

### Run the program 
python3 count_schools.py
